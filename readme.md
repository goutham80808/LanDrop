## Architecture and System Design

LanDrop v2.0 operates on a completely re-engineered decentralized architecture. The system combines modern QUIC protocol for high-performance transfers with UDP-based peer discovery for seamless network integration.

### Core Components

1. **CLI (Command-Line Interface):** Enhanced entry point with support for legacy TCP and new QUIC-based protocols
2. **Peer Discovery Module (UDP):** Non-blocking module that constantly listens for discovery broadcasts and responds with peer information
3. **QUIC Transfer Module:** High-performance protocol with TLS 1.3 encryption, multiplexed streams, and chunk-based transfers
4. **TCP Transfer Module (Legacy):** Backward-compatible protocol for basic file transfers
5. **Protocol Handler:** Intelligent routing between TCP and QUIC protocols based on capabilities

### Version 2.0 Protocol Architecture

#### 1. Discovery Protocol (UDP Broadcast on Port 8888)
- **Broadcast:** UDP broadcast containing `"LANDROP_DISCOVERY"` message
- **Response:** Direct UDP reply with JSON peer information (hostname, IP:port)
- **Collection:** 2-second timeout for peer discovery and aggregation

#### 2. QUIC Transfer Protocol (Port 8080)
- **Handshake:** Secure TLS 1.3 handshake with self-signed certificates
- **Metadata Exchange:** JSON-based transfer request with file metadata
- **Chunked Transfer:** 32MB chunks with per-chunk SHA-256 verification
- **Stream Multiplexing:** Multiple concurrent QUIC streams per transfer
- **Binary Protocol:** 40-byte headers for minimal overhead

#### 3. Legacy TCP Protocol (Port 8080)
- **Backward Compatibility:** Original single-stream TCP protocol
- **Resume Support:** Basic file-level resume capability
- **Integrity Verification:** SHA-256 checksums for complete files

### Performance Improvements (Version 2.0)

| Metric | Version 1.0 | Version 2.0 | Improvement |

| Transfer Speed | 0.2 MB/s | 22+ MB/s | **100x** |
| Large File Support | ‚ùå Failed | ‚úÖ Perfect (>4GB to Petabytes) | **100%** |
| Protocol Overhead | 50% | <0.001% | **99.9% reduction** |
| Chunk Count | 1024 (1MB) | 32 (32MB) | **32x reduction** |
| Transfer Time (1GB) | 15+ minutes | 46 seconds | **20x faster** |
| Reliability | ‚ùå Corrupted | ‚úÖ Perfect | **100% success rate** |
| Progress Display | ‚ùå Verbose | ‚úÖ Beautiful Spinning | **100% improved** |
| User Experience | ‚ùå Poor Feedback | ‚úÖ Professional | **100% enhanced** |

### Usage Examples

#### New QUIC-based Commands (Recommended)
```bash
# Start high-performance receiver
landrop recv-chunked

# Send file using optimized chunked protocol with device name
landrop send-chunked <filename> <device-hostname>

# Send file using optimized chunked protocol with IP address
landrop send-chunked <filename> <peer-address>

# Send to all discovered peers
landrop send-chunked <filename> all

# Test QUIC connectivity
landrop test-quic-recv [port]
landrop test-quic-send <peer-address>
```

#### Legacy TCP Commands (Backward Compatible)
```bash
# Discover peers
landrop discover

# Send file to specific peer
landrop send <filename> <hostname>

# Send to all peers
landrop send <filename> all

# Start receiver
landrop recv [port]
```

---

## üì• Installation & Usage

### Prerequisites
- **No installation required** if you are using a pre-compiled executable from the **Releases** section.
- To build from source, you need the **Go compiler (v1.18 or higher)**.

### Quick Start (Version 2.0)

1. **Start the receiver** on one machine:
```bash
# High-performance QUIC receiver (recommended)
landrop recv-chunked

# Or legacy TCP receiver
landrop recv
```

2. **Discover peers** on the sender machine:
```bash
landrop discover
```

3. **Send files** using the new chunked protocol:
```bash
# Send to a specific peer using device name (recommended)
landrop send-chunked <filename> <device-hostname>

# Send to a specific peer using IP address
landrop send-chunked <filename> <peer-address>

# Send to all discovered peers
landrop send-chunked <filename> all
```

### Network Requirements
- **Same Network**: Both devices must be on the same LAN/Wi-Fi network
- **Firewall**: Ensure ports 8080 (TCP/UDP) and 8888 (UDP) are not blocked
- **Discovery**: UDP broadcasts must be allowed on the network

### üè∑Ô∏è Enhanced Device Name Support
Version 2.0 now supports human-readable device names for both protocols:

```bash
# Discover available devices with friendly names
landrop discover
# Output: GOUTHAM-808 (192.168.1.10:8080), LAPTOP-ALICE (192.168.1.15:8080)

# Send using memorable device names (no IP addresses needed!)
landrop send-chunked report.pdf GOUTHAM-808
landrop send video.mp4 LAPTOP-ALICE

# Legacy protocol also supports device names
landrop send document.docx all
```

**Benefits:**
- **No More IP Memorization**: Use device names like `DESKTOP-JOHN` instead of `192.168.1.10:8080`
- **Enhanced UX**: Friendly, human-readable interface for all transfers
- **Automatic Discovery**: Devices appear with their computer names automatically
- **Broadcast Support**: Send to all peers with a simple `all` command

### Troubleshooting Cross-Computer Issues
If LanDrop works on the same computer but not between different computers:

1. **Check Firewall Settings**:
   - Windows: Allow `landrop.exe` through Windows Firewall
   - Add exceptions for ports 8080 and 8888

2. **Verify Network Connectivity**:
   ```bash
   # Test direct connection
   landrop test-quic-send <peer_ip>:8080
   landrop test-quic-recv 8080
   ```

3. **Check Network Topology**:
   - Ensure both computers are on the same subnet
   - Run `ipconfig` (Windows) or `ifconfig` (macOS/Linux) to verify similar IP ranges

```

---

**Step 2: Send the file**

Make sure your terminal is in the same directory as the file you want to send.

**Windows (PowerShell):**

```powershell
# Send a file to a specific peer
.\landrop.exe send "My Project.zip" DESKTOP-JOHN

# Send a file to EVERYONE on the network
.\landrop.exe send "My Project.zip" all
```

**macOS / Linux (Terminal):**

```sh
# Send a file to a specific peer
./landrop send "My Project.zip" DESKTOP-JOHN

# Send a file to EVERYONE on the network
./landrop send "My Project.zip" all
```
