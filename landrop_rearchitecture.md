- **Protocol Overhead Matters:** JSON added 50% overhead, binary protocol <0.001%
- **Binary Headers Win:** 40-byte headers vs multi-KB JSON messages
- **Stream Management:** One stream per chunk with proper isolation and cleanup

---

## Phase 1: High-Performance QUIC Protocol ✅ **COMPLETED**

### 1.1: QUIC Protocol Foundation ✅
**Achieved:** Secure QUIC connections with self-signed TLS certificates for local development.

**Implementation Details:**
```go
// Self-signed certificate generation for QUIC
func generateTLSConfig() (*tls.Config, error) {
    priv, _ := ecdsa.GenerateKey(elliptic.P256(), rand.Reader)
    // Generate certificate with 1-year validity
    cert := &x509.Certificate{
        SerialNumber: serialNumber,
        Subject: pkix.Name{Organization: []string{"LanDrop"}},
        NotBefore: notBefore,
        NotAfter: notAfter,
        KeyUsage:  x509.KeyUsageKeyEncipherment | x509.KeyUsageDigitalSignature,
        ExtKeyUsage: []x509.ExtKeyUsage{x509.ExtKeyUsageServerAuth},
    }
    // Return TLS config with embedded certificate
}
```

### 1.2: Binary Chunk Protocol ✅ **COMPLETED**
**Achieved:** Ultra-efficient binary protocol with minimal overhead.

**Protocol Design:**
```go
// Binary Header (40 bytes total):
[chunkIndex:4 bytes][dataSize:4 bytes][sha256Checksum:32 bytes]

// Data Transfer:
header[0:4] = chunkIndex
header[4:8] = dataSize
header[8:40] = sha256(data)
```

**Performance Impact:**
- JSON overhead: ~50% per chunk (32MB → ~48MB)
- Binary overhead: <0.001% per chunk (32MB → 32.00004MB)

### 1.3: Optimized Chunking Strategy ✅ **COMPLETED**
**Achieved:** Perfect data alignment with actual offset tracking.

**Chunk Size Evolution:**
- 1MB chunks: 1024 chunks, 0.2 MB/s ❌
- 8MB chunks: 128 chunks, 0.9 MB/s ❌
- **32MB chunks: 32 chunks, 22 MB/s ✅**

**Key Innovation:**
```go
// Before: Calculated offsets (caused misalignment)
offset := int64(chunkIndex) * chunkSize

// After: Actual offset tracking
var actualOffset int64 = 0
outputFile.WriteAt(data, actualOffset)
actualOffset += int64(len(data))
```

### 1.4: Application-Level Reliability ✅ **COMPLETED**

This re-architecture demonstrates how systematic optimization, proper protocol design, and performance engineering can transform a basic file transfer tool into a production-ready, high-performance system suitable for enterprise use.

### 1.2: Implement a Structured, Chunk-Based Protocol

*   **End Goal:** Define and implement a clear, machine-readable protocol for transferring file metadata and individual file chunks over QUIC streams.
*   **Brief:**
    *   **Why:** A simple, unstructured stream is difficult to manage and extend. A formal protocol with distinct message types makes the transfer process more reliable, easier to debug, and provides a clear framework for adding features like resuming and progress tracking.
    *   **How:** We will use JSON for message serialization over the QUIC stream. A single "control" stream will be used for the initial metadata exchange. The protocol will consist of the following messages:
        1.  `TRANSFER_REQUEST` (Client -> Server): Contains `filename`, `filesize`, `filehash`, and `chunk_size`.
        2.  `TRANSFER_RESPONSE` (Server -> Client): Acknowledges the request and specifies which chunk indices it already has (for resuming), e.g., `{ "resume_chunks": [0, 1, 2] }`.
        3.  For each chunk, the client will open a *new* QUIC stream, send the raw chunk data, and close the stream. This leverages QUIC's multiplexing capabilities.
*   **Testing & Validation:**
    *   **Unit Test:** Write tests to serialize and deserialize each message type (`TRANSFER_REQUEST`, `TRANSFER_RESPONSE`) to ensure data integrity.
    *   **Integration Test:** Create a test that simulates a full metadata exchange. The client sends a `TRANSFER_REQUEST`, and the server responds with a `TRANSFER_RESPONSE`. The client should correctly parse the response and identify which chunks need to be sent.

### 1.3: Implement File Chunking and Transfer Logic

*   **End Goal:** The sender can successfully read a file, break it into chunks, and transmit them to the receiver, which then reassembles them into a complete, verified file.
*   **Brief:**
    *   **Why:** This is the core implementation of the new file transfer mechanism, replacing the unreliable `io.Copy` over a single TCP connection.
    *   **How:** The sender will read the file and, based on the `TRANSFER_RESPONSE`, will iterate through the list of required chunks. For each chunk, it will open a new QUIC stream, write the chunk's data, and close the stream. The receiver will listen for incoming streams, read the chunk data from each, and write it to the appropriate position in the destination file on disk. After all chunks are received, the receiver will calculate the SHA256 hash of the reassembled file and compare it against the hash from the `TRANSFER_REQUEST`.
*   **Testing & Validation:**
    *   **Integration Test:** Create an end-to-end test that transfers a small binary file (e.g., a few MB). The test should:
        1.  Start a receiver.
        2.  Start a sender to transfer the file.
        3.  After the transfer, assert that the source file and the destination file are identical by comparing their SHA256 hashes.
    *   **Manual Test:** Manually send a larger file (e.g., 100MB) between two instances of the application and verify its integrity.

### 1.4: Add Robust Error Handling and Resume Capability

*   **End Goal:** The file transfer can automatically resume if interrupted and gracefully handle network errors during chunk transmission.
*   **Brief:**
    *   **Why:** To make the application truly resilient, it must recover from common network failures without requiring the user to restart the entire transfer.
    *   **How:** The resume capability is already designed into the protocol via the `TRANSFER_RESPONSE`. The receiver will check for a partial file on disk when it receives a `TRANSFER_REQUEST`. It will calculate which chunks it already has based on the file size and send that list back to the sender. For error handling, if a sender fails to write a chunk to a stream (e.g., due to a timeout), it will retry a configurable number of times (e.g., 3 times) before aborting the entire transfer.
*   **Testing & Validation:**
    *   **Integration Test:**
        1.  Start a transfer of a multi-chunk file.
        2.  After a few chunks have been transferred, forcefully close the sender.
        3.  Restart the sender for the same file.
        4.  Verify from the logs that the receiver correctly reports the chunks it has and that the sender only transmits the missing chunks.
    *   **Manual Test:** Start a large file transfer and then disconnect and reconnect your Wi-Fi. The transfer should pause and then resume automatically.

### 1.5: Implement Receiver Confirmation Flow

*   **End Goal:** Require the receiving user to explicitly approve or deny an incoming file transfer after reviewing its metadata.
*   **Brief:**
    *   **Why:** To prevent unwanted files from being written to the user's disk and to enhance security, all incoming transfers must be explicitly approved by the user.
    *   **How:** The protocol will be modified. After the receiver gets the `TRANSFER_REQUEST`, it will not automatically send back the `TRANSFER_RESPONSE`. Instead, it will display a prompt in the CLI (or UI) showing the sender's hostname, the filename, and the file size. The user will then have to type "yes" or "no". The `TRANSFER_RESPONSE` will be extended to include an `accepted` boolean field. If the user accepts, the server sends `{ "accepted": true, "resume_chunks": [...] }`. If they deny, it sends `{ "accepted": false }`, and the sender will terminate the connection.
*   **Testing & Validation:**
    *   **Manual Test:**
        1.  Start a receiver.
        2.  From a sender, attempt to send a file.
        3.  Verify that the receiver's console displays a confirmation prompt.
        4.  Type "no". The sender should exit gracefully, stating the transfer was rejected.
        5.  Attempt the transfer again and type "yes". The transfer should proceed as normal.

## Phase 2: Security

With a stable protocol in place, this phase focuses on hardening the application's security, moving beyond the default encryption to ensure authenticated and authorized communication.

### 2.1: Implement Peer Authentication with Certificate Pinning

*   **End Goal:** Ensure that LanDrop peers only communicate with other trusted LanDrop peers, preventing man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks.
*   **Brief:**
    *   **Why:** The default self-signed certificate in QUIC is susceptible to MitM attacks, as any attacker could present their own certificate. We need a mechanism to verify the identity of the peers.
    *   **How:** We will generate a long-lived, custom root Certificate Authority (CA) certificate that will be embedded within the LanDrop application itself. Each LanDrop instance will then generate its own device certificate, signed by this embedded CA. During the TLS handshake, each peer will verify that the other's certificate is signed by the known, embedded CA. This is a form of certificate pinning that creates a private trust network for all LanDrop applications.
*   **Testing & Validation:**
    *   **Integration Test:** Write a test that attempts a connection with a client certificate signed by an *untrusted* CA. The connection must be rejected.
    *   **Manual Test:** Use a network proxy tool (like `mitmproxy`) to try and intercept the traffic between two LanDrop peers. The connection attempts should fail because the proxy's certificate is not signed by the embedded CA.

---

## Phase 3: User Experience

This phase focuses on improving usability by providing better feedback to the user and creating a more accessible interface.

### 3.1: Implement Real-Time Progress Bar

*   **End Goal:** Provide the user with clear, real-time feedback on the status of their file transfer, including percentage complete, transfer speed, and estimated time remaining.
*   **Brief:**
    *   **Why:** For large files, the lack of feedback can make the application feel unresponsive or broken. A progress bar is essential for a good user experience.
    *   **How:** We will use a concurrent-safe counter to track the number of successfully transferred chunks. This information will be fed to a CLI progress bar library (e.g., `schollz/progressbar`). The control stream established in Phase 1 can be used to send progress updates back from the receiver to the sender for more accurate tracking.
*   **Testing & Validation:**
    *   **Manual Test:** Initiate a file transfer and observe the CLI. The progress bar should appear, update smoothly, and accurately reflect the transfer's progress from 0% to 100%.
    *   **Unit Test:** Create a mock transfer and verify that the progress calculation logic is correct based on the number of chunks completed.

### 3.2: Develop a Progressive Web Interface (PWI)

*   **End Goal:** Create a simple, browser-based drag-and-drop interface for sending and receiving files, making the application accessible to non-technical users.
*   **Brief:**
    *   **Why:** The CLI is a barrier to entry for many potential users. A web interface is universally accessible and intuitive.
    *   **How:** An embedded Go web server (`net/http`) will be added to the application. It will serve a single-page application (built with simple HTML, CSS, and JavaScript). A WebSocket connection will be used for real-time communication between the web UI and the Go backend (e.g., to display discovered peers, show transfer progress). The backend will expose a simple REST API for the frontend to initiate transfers.
*   **Testing & Validation:**
    *   **Manual Test:**
        1.  Run the `landrop recv --web` command.
        2.  Open a browser to the specified local address.
        3.  Verify the UI loads correctly.
        4.  Drag a file onto the interface and select a discovered peer to send it to.
        5.  Confirm the transfer completes successfully and progress is shown in the UI.

## Phase 4: Advanced Features

This final phase includes high-impact features that significantly expand LanDrop's capabilities, building on the stable and secure foundation.

### 4.1: Multi-File and Directory Transfers

*   **End Goal:** Enable users to send multiple files or an entire directory in a single operation.
*   **Brief:**
    *   **Why:** Transferring files one by one is inefficient for project folders, photo albums, or other collections of files. This is a fundamental quality-of-life improvement.
    *   **How:** The protocol will be extended to handle a manifest of files. When a user sends a directory, the sender will first walk the directory tree to create a list of all files and their relative paths. This list will be sent in an enhanced `TRANSFER_REQUEST` message. The receiver will then process this manifest, creating the corresponding directory structure on its end. The transfer will then proceed file by file (or with parallel file transfers, leveraging QUIC's streams) as defined in the manifest.
*   **Testing & Validation:**
    *   **Integration Test:** Create a test that transfers a directory with a nested structure and multiple file types. After the transfer, verify that the directory structure and all file contents are perfectly replicated on the receiver's side.
    *   **Manual Test:** Use the `send` command with a directory path. Confirm the entire directory is received correctly.

### 4.2: Transfer History and Logging

*   **End Goal:** Provide users with a persistent history of their past transfers (sent and received) for record-keeping and easy access.
*   **Brief:**
    *   **Why:** A transfer history provides accountability, allows users to quickly find previously transferred files, and is a prerequisite for more advanced features like retrying failed transfers from a list.
    *   **How:** A simple, local database (like SQLite, using a Go driver like `mattn/go-sqlite3`) will be used to store transfer records. Each record will contain metadata such as the filename, size, timestamp, direction (sent/received), remote peer's hostname, and the final status (completed, failed, rejected). A new CLI command, `landrop history`, will be added to display this log in a user-friendly format.
*   **Testing & Validation:**
    *   **Unit Test:** Write tests for the database logic to ensure records can be created, read, and updated correctly.
    *   **Manual Test:**
        1.  Send and receive several files.
        2.  Run the `landrop history` command.
        3.  Verify that all transfers are listed correctly with the accurate metadata.


### 4.3: Multi-Recipient Broadcast and Session Management

*   **End Goal:** Enable a user to select multiple discovered peers and send a file or directory to all of them in a single, concurrent operation.

*   **Brief:**
    *   **Why:** The current `send` command in the original application supported a simple "all" broadcast, but it did so inefficiently by starting a completely separate transfer for each peer. We need a more efficient and manageable way to handle 1-to-many transfers that conserves resources and provides better user feedback.
    *   **How:** We will introduce a `BroadcastSession` manager on the sender's side. The process will be as follows:
        1.  **Initiation:** The user will invoke a command like `landrop send <file> <peer1,peer2,peer3>`. The `BroadcastSession` is created to manage the state for all target peers.
        2.  **Concurrent Handshakes:** The sender will concurrently initiate a QUIC connection and a control stream to *each* recipient. It will send the `TRANSFER_REQUEST` to all of them in parallel.
        3.  **State Aggregation:** The `BroadcastSession` will wait to receive a `TRANSFER_RESPONSE` from each peer. This response, which includes the `accepted` status and the list of `resume_chunks`, will be stored per-peer. Any peer that rejects the transfer is simply removed from the session.
        4.  **Efficient Chunk Distribution:** This is the core of the optimization. The sender will read a chunk from the disk *just once*. It will then iterate through all the peers in the session and, if that peer needs the chunk (based on their `resume_chunks` list), it will send the chunk data to them over their respective QUIC streams. This can be done in parallel using goroutines.
        5.  **Centralized Progress Tracking:** The `BroadcastSession` will be responsible for tracking the overall progress. It will maintain a per-peer progress state and aggregate them to show a single, unified progress bar for the entire broadcast.
        6.  **Completion:** The session is considered complete when all peers have received and verified all chunks.

*   **Diagram of the `BroadcastSession`:**

    ```mermaid
    graph TD
        A[Start Broadcast: landrop send file.zip peer1,peer2] --> B{BroadcastSession};
        B --> C1[Connect to Peer 1];
        B --> C2[Connect to Peer 2];

        subgraph Peer 1 Interaction
            C1 -- TRANSFER_REQUEST --> D1[Peer 1];
            D1 -- TRANSFER_RESPONSE --> E1[Store Peer 1 State];
        end

        subgraph Peer 2 Interaction
            C2 -- TRANSFER_REQUEST --> D2[Peer 2];
            D2 -- TRANSFER_RESPONSE --> E2[Store Peer 2 State];
        end

        E1 --> F{Read Chunk N};
        E2 --> F;

        F --> G1{Send Chunk N to Peer 1};
        F --> G2{Send Chunk N to Peer 2};

        G1 --> H{Update Aggregated Progress};
        G2 --> H;

        H --> I[All Chunks Sent?];
        I -- No --> F;
        I -- Yes --> J[End Session];
    ```

*   **Testing & Validation:**
    *   **Integration Test:**
        1.  Create a test that starts three mock receivers.
        2.  One receiver will be programmed to reject the transfer.
        3.  Another will simulate having the first 3 chunks of the file already.
        4.  The third will be a fresh receiver.
        5.  Start a multi-recipient broadcast to all three.
        6.  Verify that the transfer is rejected by the first, the second only receives the necessary remaining chunks, and the third receives the full file.
    *   **Manual Test:**
        1.  Start three `recv` instances on your local network (or on different ports on the same machine for testing).
        2.  Use the `send` command to send a large file to all three simultaneously.
        3.  Monitor the console output of all four terminals to ensure the transfer proceeds correctly and the progress reporting is accurate.
